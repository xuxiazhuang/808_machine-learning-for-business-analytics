    "What Are PipelinesÂ¶\n",
    "\n",
    "Pipelines are a simple way to keep your data processing and modeling code organized. Specifically, a pipeline bundles preprocessing and modeling steps so you can use the whole bundle as if it were a single step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many data scientists hack together models without pipelines, but Pipelines have some important benefits. Those include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cleaner Code: You won't need to keep track of your training (and validation) data at each step of processing. Accounting for data at each step of processing can get messy. With a pipeline, you don't need to manually keep track of each step.\n",
    "Fewer Bugs: There are fewer opportunities to mis-apply a step or forget a pre-processing step.\n",
    "Easier to Productionize: It can be surprisingly hard to transition a model from a prototype to something deployable at scale. We won't go into the many related concerns here, but pipelines can help.\n",
    "More Options For Model Testing: You will see an example in the next tutorial, which covers cross-validation."

    "We won't focus on the data loading. For now, you can imagine you are at a point where you already have train_X, test_X, train_y and test_y.\n",
    "You have a modeling process that uses an Imputer to fill in missing values, followed by a RandomForestRegressor to make predictions. These can be bundled together with the make_pipeline function as shown below."

    "Understanding Pipelines\n",
    "Most scikit-learn objects are either transformers or models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformers are for pre-processing before modeling. The Imputer class (for filling in missing values) is an example of a transformer. Over time, you will learn many more transformers, and you will frequently use multiple transformers sequentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "Models are used to make predictions. You will usually preprocess your data (with transformers) before putting it in a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can tell if an object is a transformer or a model by how you apply it. After fitting a transformer, you apply it with the transform command. After fitting a model, you apply it with the predict command. Your pipeline must start with transformer steps and end with a model. This is what you'd want anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually you will want to apply more transformers and combine them more flexibly. We will cover this later in an Advanced Pipelines tutorial."
